_Game Description I'm giving you to help me implement_
We are going to implement a new game called "Symptoms Link". The game consists of guessing which disease matches all the symptoms being shown.

The game has 5 panels where the symptoms will appear. At the start, only one symptom will be shown, and the user has to either guess a disease or press the "skip" button, if he guesses correctly, he wins! If he doesn't guess correctly, it does the same as the skip button, which is showing a second symptom

The symptoms will keep appearing while guesses are incorrect or skip is pressed, until all 5 symptoms are shown. When the 5 symptoms are all revealed, then the "skip" button turns into a "give up" button. Either a final guess is made, or the player gives up, if the guess is incorrect, the game is lost. 


_Game Description the user sees before playing:_
In Symptom Link, you must prove your diagnosing skills, as you'll have to guess the Disease that connects all the given symptoms.

The game will start showing one symptom, and you can guess diseases or skip to see more. Once all five symptoms are revealed, you have one final guess to make. 


We will implement this step by step, the following steps are the ones to design in our HTML, CSS and JavaScript Set Ups. These are the first 5 Steps for Basic Game Function Set-Up.

**Step 1 | Basic Layout**
- empty cells, mistery disease
- starting symptom shows


**Step 2 | Guessing shows new symptom**
- explica the title says, yk
- mensaje de "incorrect", por ahora para todas


**Step 3 | Skip Button for symptoms**
- skip shows new symptom
- skip turns to "give up" after all are shown


**Step 4 | Guessing correctly wins**
- takes to the "You Won" panel


**Step 5 | Losing the game**
- when all symptoms revealed, guessing wrongly or clicking on "give up" take you to the "You Lost" screen
